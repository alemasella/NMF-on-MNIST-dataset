This project is divided in two parts: the first one tries to understand how the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) works as a method to compact information in lower dimensions, while the second part studies the optimization of the NMF method. All the work done in this project is on the MNIST dataset, very important in machine learning.

Every step is already explained in each part of the project.
